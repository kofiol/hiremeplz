# ⚠️ ABANDONED: Job Scraping & Matching

**Status:** ABANDONED (Coming back to this soon)

**DO NOT TOUCH** - This feature is not in active development and should not be included in code reviews or context injections.

## What Was This?

This directory was intended to house job scraping and matching APIs. It's currently empty and incomplete.

## Why Abandoned?

Job scraping and matching features were deprioritized to focus on:
- `/overview` agent development (context injection, tool usage, reasoning)
- Onboarding UX improvements
- LinkedIn profile scraping (now fully working)

## When Returning

When job scraping is resumed:
- Update this README with implementation details
- Ensure proper tool definitions for the `/overview` agent
- Consider context efficiency for agent decision-making
- Align with current agent architecture patterns
